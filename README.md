# What is Estela {#what-is-estela}

Estela is an StratML3 form and follow up application.

## What is StratML3 {#what-is-stratml3}

StratML is the main strategic planning standard, with both ISO and ANSI registered versions. StratML is a document based format that can be used to design and track strategic plans, broad planning initiatives that involve a considerable number of resources, people or time.

StratML3 is the latest evolution of the standard. Includes improvements in the plan context description elements, links to external references like other plans or categorization elements that can also be used to connect plans to rdf data \(wikidata, etc.\).

## Why should I use StratML {#why-should-i-use-stratml}

StratML is a reference for guiding the production of consistent strategic plans. A reference to guide the strategic planning of an organization. StratML describes the expected elements and relations that a Strategic plan should have.

A formal format, like StratML, enables the posibility to process it with shared tools, extract information automatically, keep track of changes or get different views of the information for different environments \(like web, paper, ereaders, etc.\). It involves more preparation and more constraints than producing free form documents, but it can be used in far more powerful ways.

Several knowledge and content management processes usedocument based data like Your car intructions manual, plane manteinance manuals, big libraries files, book or law publishing.

Information typing, by hand or with the help of tools like Estela, is a key practice to produce consistent data that has a contained volume of data instances but a high level of complexity and disparity. This practice is useful when thereï¿½s time to prepare and review the information.

## How does Estela work {#how-does-estela-work}

Estela is based on Salvora, a small server like component that enable access to local forms, data and transformations using a web browser.

# StratML {#stratml}

## StratML3 {#stratml3}

StratML 3 is the last version/evolution of the StratML standard. The third version includes a new group of elements to describe the plan context.

It also includes a full set of elements to relate the plan to external references, like rdf links and external or add hoc categorization.

## StratML groups of information. {#stratml-groups-of-information}

### Main View, Purpose, Values, .. {#main-view-purpose-values-}

Starting point about the plan. Used to share the view and understanding about the plan purpose.

### Context \(PERT, SWOT, Driving Forces\) {#context-pert-swot-driving-forces}

New StratML 3 elements to share information about the plan context and the events that can impact the plan outcome.

### Goals, Objectives, and Indicators {#goals-objectives-and-indicators}

This section describes the main dimensions of the initative intentions and the outcomes.

### Administrative Information {#administrative-information}

This group of elements hold information like the plan issuer, contact information, planning publication date, etc.

# Creating and following Strategic plans with Estela. {#creating-and-following-strategic-plans-with-estela}

## Estela main functionalities {#estela-main-functionalities}

Estela is based mostly on plans, plan evaluation rules and plan groups.

StratML3 plans evaluation is based on Goals, Objectives and indicators. For each plan that should be evaluated numerically you must define a set evaluation of evaluation rules \(one for each indicator\).

In order to follow up plans you should define a set of groups, from the plan groups you can drill down to each plan.

## Creating your first plan {#creating-your-first-plan}

In order to create a plan go to the plan functionality and click on create a new plan.

## The elements that matter for following up and reporting {#the-elements-that-matter-for-following-up-and-reporting}

There's a lot of information that can be useful on a plan, several groups on information regarding the plan view, the background information, etc.

Plan advance and expectations is defined based on Goals, Objectives and Indicators. Performance Indicators has also measurement instances where you can add the target and the actual results.

## Configuring your plan evaluation {#configuring-your-plan-evaluation}

Once you have your plan data and a set of results you need to configure the evaluation rules. The evaluation rules does exactly that indcate how the actual results shold be compared to the target result. For each indicator you can state if a bigger or lower value it's better, etc.

The complexity of the indicator evaluation rules should be improved in future releases allowing for more descriptive combinations and cases.

## Define a plan group {#define-a-plan-group}

Even though a plan could be evaluated directly, Estela is based on plan groups. A plan group can be used to compare plans and broad initiatives combined.

To define a plan group navigate from the home folder to "Plan groups/Manage", and then "New Plan Group". Fill the form and make sure to include at least one plan.

## Browse plan follow up reports {#browse-plan-follow-up-reports}

From the main menu go to Follow Up, Estela will list the plan groups with the main result diagrams. From the follow up group list you can drill down to a single plan group, and from there to each plan.

## Configure the main evaluation parameters {#configure-the-main-evaluation-parameters}

The main evaluation configuration can be adjusted in the configuration section. This section is currently in development.
